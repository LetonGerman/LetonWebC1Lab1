            German (born August 20, 1972) grew up in Antibes, France together with his
            brother Yann. His family had a great interest in football and Gonzalez had trials with AS Cannes,
            while his maternal grandfather is the French international Laurent Robuschi. At the age of 14 he got
            injured and turned to music instead after his parents bought him a guitar. Gonzalez developed his
            interest in music further and American culture while at secondary school. Together with Fromageau he formed
            a post-rock outfit called My Violent Wish.
