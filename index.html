            German (born August 20, 1972) grew up in Antibes, France together with his
            brother Yann. His family had a great interest in football and Gonzalez had trials with AS Cannes,
            while his maternal grandfather is the French international Laurent Robuschi. At the age of 14 he got
            injured and turned to music instead after his parents bought him a guitar. Gonzalez developed his
            interest in music further and American culture while at secondary school. Together with Fromageau he formed
            a post-rock outfit called My Violent Wish.

        <h3>Why Earl Scruggs was the Beethoven of the banjo</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a couple of months last year studying bluegrass in North Carolina, and I learned that there are is
            one tune you never ask a banjo player to play for you. Foggy Mountain Breakdown, Earl Scruggs's most famous
            instrumental, is a tune so familiar, so oft-played, that even suggesting it at a jam will mark you out as an
            idiot know-nothing newcomer. It's the equivalent of self-identifying as a Trekkie, when the correct term is
            Trekker.

            If you know one banjo tune – well, if you only know one – it's probably Duelling Banjos, and you probably
            heard it in the film Deliverance, or in one of the endless pastiches you can now watch on YouTube (my
            favourite is this one from Father Ted). But if you know two, then the other one, I will bet you now, was
            written by Earl Scruggs. Scruggs was the most influential banjo player there has ever been: he was banjo's
            Bach, Beethoven and Bob Dylan all rolled into one. He pioneered the three-finger style of picking
            responsible for the sound you hear whenever you think of the instrument's fleet-fingered, jangling sound.
            Until then, banjo players was played in the traditional "clawhammer" style – Scruggs's use of the third
            finger allowed him to play the driving arpeggios that we associate with banjo music today.

            And it was his virtuosity that brought banjo to the forefront of the newly emergent country music of the
            1940s, where it had previously been an instrument of accompaniment (just like the guitar, or, as they say in
            the mountains, gee-tar). That new music was bluegrass, and Scruggs made banjo its defining sound. As the
            comedian Steve Martin wrote last year, in a tribute to his bluegrass mentor: "Few players have changed the
            way we hear an instrument the way Earl has, putting him in a category with Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong,
            Chet Atkins, and Jimi Hendrix." Scruggs's legacy is a sound that Martin could describe in just one word:
            "Unmistakable".

            I visited Shelby, where Scruggs was born, on my bluegrass travels. It wasn't the most thrilling place to
            visit: a typical main strip where you must drive from one parking lot to the next to go shopping; one
            popular annual event is its festival of liver mush. But it knows its place on the map, and that's why the
            first thing you see when you enter its city limits is the sign proclaiming "Birthplace of Earl Scruggs".
            Today everyone in that town who owns a banjo will be out picking on their porch paying tribute. And, I
            suspect, for once, there will be an amnesty on Foggy Mountain Breakdown.
